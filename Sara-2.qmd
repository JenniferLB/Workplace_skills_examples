title: "Temporary employment - bivariate relationships"
---

## Context

Sara wants to examine if job permanency affects job satisfaction. She thinks that non-permanent (temporary) employees might have lower levels of job satisfaction because they feel less secure. She has identified relevant variables and is keen to explore the data.

## What techniques?

::: panel-tabset
Sara works on her research questions and starts to think about the techniques can she use. For each of the research questions below, select an appropriate method of exploring the relationship.

1.  Is there any gender difference in permanent employment?
2.  Is job permanency related to usual hours worked (i.e. are those in non-permanent jobs likely to work more hours)?
3.  Do those with a permanent job report higher levels of job satisfaction?

## Answers

1.  Both variables are categorical she can use a crosstabulation and compare percentages. She could use a clustered or stacked bar chart.
2.  She could compare means to examine hours worked for those is permanent jobs and those that are not in permanent jobs.
3.  Both are categorical variables. We could use a cross-tabulation to examine the relationship between these two categorical variables. As job satisfaction is ordinal, she could consider comparing average scores for job satisfaction for those with permanent and non-permanent jobs (but not all statisticians or researchers agree with this approach).

## Crosstabulation: gender differences in permanent employment

Sara is eager to look at the data. She creates the following table to examine if there are gender differences in permanent employment.

## Questions

1.  Based on this table, which of the following can she conclude?

-   a\) 4.9% of those in 'temporary employment with no agreed end date' are women

-   b\) 91.5% of females are in permanent employment

-   c\) A and B

-   d\) None

## Answers

-   b\) 91.5% of females are in permanent employment

## Examining hours worked by job permanency?

Is job permanency related to usual hours worked (i.e. are those in non-permanent jobs likely to work more hours or less hours)? For this question, Sara gets the following output.
