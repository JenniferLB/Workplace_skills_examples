title: "Trade unions and maternity benefits - crosstabulation and chi-square test"
---

## Context

Ahmed is interested in examining the impact of trade unions. Specifically, he wants to investigate the following question:

-   Do workplaces with trade unions offer better maternity benefits?

He has the following ideas:

-   Yes, they will do because trade unions negotiate for better employee benefits. A causal relationship.

-   Yes, there will be an association because workplaces open to trade union membership treat employees better generally. An association due to some general approach taken by employers.

Either 1 or 2 suggest we should find some association.  

## Hypotheses

::: panel-tabset
## Questions

1.  Translate his theory into hypothesis to test:

-   H0=?

-   H1=?

## Answers

1.  Translate his theory into hypothesis to test:

-   H0= no association (independent of each other)

    H1=an association between presence of trade unions and maternity pay (dependent on each other)

## Frequencies

Below us a summary of the two variables.

**Are any of the employees here members of a trade union or independent staff association?**

|       |           |         |
|-------|-----------|---------|
|       | Frequency | Percent |
| Yes   | 1326      | 57.8    |
| No    | 969       | 42.2    |
| Total | 2295      | 100.0   |

**Would any female employees going on maternity leave from this workplace receive their normal, full rate of pay?**

|                |           |         |               |
|----------------|-----------|---------|---------------|
|                | Frequency | Percent | Valid Percent |
| Yes            | 1360      | 59.3    | 62.6          |
| No             | 813       | 35.4    | 37.4          |
| Total          | 2173      | 94.7    | 100.0         |
| Refusal        | 6         | .3      |               |
| Don't know     | 68        | 3.0     |               |
| Not applicable | 48        | 2.1     |               |
| Total          | 122       | 5.3     |               |

## Crosstabulation

Ahemed examines a crosstabulation with:

-   Employees members of a trade union (yes/no) in the columns

-   Maternity pay=full pay (yes/no) in the rows

### Column percentages

Ahmed creates the table using column percentages.

::: panel-tabset
## Questions

1.  What percentage of workplaces with trade union members does maternity pay equal full pay?

2.  What percentage of workplaces with no trade union members does maternity pay equal to full pay?

3.  What percentage of all work places does maternity pay equal to full pay?

## Answers

1.  In 72 percent of workplaces with trade union members, maternity pay equals full pay.

2.  Only, 50 percent of workplaces with no trade union members have maternity equal to full pay.  

3.  Overall, in 63 percent of workplaces, maternity pay equals full pay.

### Row percentages

Ahmed creates the table with row percentages.

![](images/clipboard-1024299767.png)

::: panel-tabset
## Questions

1.  What percentage of workplaces have trade unions? Are trade unions more or less common in workplaces where maternity pay equals full pay?

2.  Why do the row and column percentages differ here?

## Answers

1.  59 percent of workplaces have trade union members. According to this data, workplaces where maternity pay equals full pay are more likely to have trade unions (67%) than workplaces overall. Where maternity pay does not equal full pay, 55 percent do not have trade union members.

2.  Why do the row and column percentages differ here?

    -   The row percent and column percent break up the sample in different ways.

    -   In the first table, when we calculate that “In 72 percent of workplaces with trade union members, maternity pay equals full pay” we are only considering workplaces with trade union members.

    -   In the second table, we calculate the 67 percent, by only looking at workplaces where maternity pay equals full pay.

    -   The cases we consider when calculating the row and column percentages vary.

## Chi-square test

::: panel-tabset
## Questions

Ahmed examines a chi-square test. What does he conclude?

## Answers

P\<0.05 – we reject the null hypothesis. There is evidence that these variables are not independent of each other.
