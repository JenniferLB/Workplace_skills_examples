title: "Dimensions of work-related stress"

## Context

Marcos is examining work-related stress. From an initial search of a datasets, he finds several relevant variables, each of which captures agreement with one of the following statements:

-   My job requires that I work very hard

-   I never seem to have enough time to get my work done

-   I feel my job is secure in this workplace

-   I worry a lot about my work outside working hours

Lower score = more agreement with the statement. 

He wants to examine how strongly related these variables are to each other. He looks at the correlations between them using a correlation matrix.

1.  Identify which values are the correlation coefficients and determine:

    -   the strongest association?

    -   the weakest association?

2.  This table reports the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients, why might this be the best choice in the situation?
