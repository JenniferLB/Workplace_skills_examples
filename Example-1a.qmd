## Context

Sara has decided to examine job permanency. She is interested in how job permanency affects job satisfaction. She thinks that non-permanent employees might have lower levels of job satisfaction because they feel less secure and are under more pressure to show their value. She also thinks that they are likely to work more hours because they feel less secure.

She knows there is some relevant data in the Workplace Employment Relations (WERS) Employee Questionnaire. But sheâ€™s confused about the variables and what techniques to use.

## Variables
