title: "Using regression to examine work-related stress"
---

## Context

Marcos is examining work related stress. He wants to use regression analysis to examine factors associated with higher levels of work-related stress. He theorises that more hours working increases the chance of work-related stress.

## A simple linear regression model

He starts with a simple model examining how **frequency of feeling worried about work** relates to the **number of hours worked**.

1.  Which is the dependent and independent variable?
2.  According to the information, does Model 1 suggests that working hours accounts for
    -   a\) 15 % of the variance in feeling worried
    -   b\) 22% of the variance in feeling worried
    -   c\) 2.2% of the variance in feeling worried

<!-- -->

3.  The F ratio implies the model is significant. Is this true or false?

4.  The model predicts that a 1 unit increase in working hours results in a -0.012 decrease in scores for worry over job (Note: lower scores indicate more worry.) Is the coefficient statistically significant?

5.  Overall, which of the following statements do the results support?

    -   a\) On average an increase in working hours is associated with lower scores on the feeling worried variable (therefore feel more worried) but the association is not statistically significant.

    -   b\) Working hours explains 22% of the variation in job stress.

    -   c\) There is a statistically significant effect of working hours on job stress but working hours does not account for much of the variation in job stress.

6\. Summarise the results in one sentence.

## Building a model: Gender, working hours and being a supervisor

Now, Marcos builds a multiple regression model to examine factors associated with work stress. He keeps ‘feeling worried’ as the the dependent (outcome) variable and has the following independent variables:

-   years working at the workplace (associated with less worry as people)

-   a dummy variable for males (which he predicts associated with less worry, as women more likely to report feeling worried)

-   being a supervisor (which he predicted is associated with more worry)

1\. From the table of coefficients, which of the following are true.

-   a\. From this model, women indicate feeling more worried than men given years in the workplace and being a supervisor.

-   b\. On average, supervisors report a score on the worry scale of -0.36 less than non-supervisors (which indicates they are more worried, as lower scores equal more worried).

-   c\. The model is significant

-   d\. Tenure is associated with less worry as Marcos predicted.

-   e\. A and B

-   f\. C and D
