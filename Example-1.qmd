title: "Temporary employment"

## Context

Sara wants to examine if job permanency affects job satisfaction. She thinks that non-permanent (temporary) employees might have lower levels of job satisfaction because they feel less secure.  She knows there is some relevant data in the Workplace Employment Relations (WERS) Employee Questionnaire. But she’s confused about the variables and what techniques to use.

## Variables

### Permanency

Sara would like to use the following question to identify those with permanent and non-permanent jobs.

1.  What level of measurement would the variable in the dataset have?

2.  She knows she needs to examine the distribution of the above variable, which techniques would be best? \[more than one option can be correct\]

-   Mean

-   Standard deviation

-   Frequency table

-   Median

-   Histogram

-   Bar chart

### Job satisfaction

In relation to job satisfaction, Sara found the following variable.

What level of measurement does it have?

Which of the following techniques can be used to examine the distriubtion of responses? \[more than option can be correct\]

-   Mean

-   Standard deviation

-   Frequency table

-   Median

-   Histogram

-   Bar chart

### Hours worked

Sarah would like to consider the number of hours people work. She finds the following variable.

1.  What level of measurement is it?

2.  What type of figure is presented above?

3.  How can we describe the distribution?

## Crosstabulation: gender differences in permanent employment

Sara is eager to look at the data. She creates the following table to examine if there are gender differences in permanent employment.

3.  Based on this table, which of the following can she conclude?

    a\) 4.9% of those in 'temporary employment with no agreed end date' are women

    b\) 91.5% of females are in permanent employment

    c\) A and B

    d\) None

## Examining hours worked by job permanency?

Is job permanency related to usual hours worked (i.e. are those in non-permanent jobs likely to work more hours or less hours)? For this question, Sara gets the following output.

4.  Which of the following are correct? \[more than one can be correct\]

    a\) Those with a permanent job work more hours on average.

    b\) Those in non-permanent jobs work more on average.

    c\) Working hours vary more among those in non-permanent jobs.

    d\) Working hours vary more among those in permanent jobs.
