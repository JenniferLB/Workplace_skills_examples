title: "Dimensions of work-related stress - correlations"
---

## Context

Marcos is examining work-related stress. He does an initial search of a relevant dataset and he finds several variables relating to different aspects of work related stress. To understand the data better he wants to examine the relationships between these variables.

## Measure of work stress

The variables each record responses to questions asking for agreement with one of the following statements:

-   My job requires that I work very hard.

-   I never seem to have enough time to get my work done.

-   I feel my job is secure in this workplace.

-   I worry a lot about my work outside working hours.

Lower score = more agreement with the statement. 

## Correlations

He wants to examine the strength of association between these variables. He looks at the correlations between them using a correlation matrix.

## Questions

1.  Identify which values are the correlation coefficients and determine:

    -   the strongest association?

    -   the weakest association?

2.  This table reports the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients, why might this be the best choice in the situation?

## Answers

1.  The correlation

    -   indicating the strongest association is 0.452, which is between 'I never seem to have enough time to get my work done’ and ‘I worry a lot about my work outside working hours’

    -   indicating the weakest association is -0.02, which is between ‘I never seem to have enough time to get my work done’ and ‘I feel secure in the workplace’.

2.  Because the variables are ordinal variables rather than truly continuous. It could also be because they are not distributed normally, but we cannot tell that from the information here.
