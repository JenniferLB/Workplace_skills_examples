title: "Dimensions of work-related stress - correlations"
---

## Context

Marcos is examining work-related stress. He does an initial search of a relevant dataset and he finds several variables relating to different aspects of work related stress. To understand the data better he wants to examine the relationships between these variables.

## Measure of work stress

The variables each record responses to questions asking for agreement with one of the following statements:

-   My job requires that I work very hard.

-   I never seem to have enough time to get my work done.

-   I feel my job is secure in this workplace.

-   I worry a lot about my work outside working hours.

Lower score = more agreement with the statement. 

## Correlations

He wants to examine the strenght of association between these variables. He looks at the correlations between them using a correlation matrix.

1.  Identify which values are the correlation coefficients and determine:

    -   the strongest association?

    -   the weakest association?

2.  This table reports the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients, why might this be the best choice in the situation?
